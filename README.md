# Dark-Sight
A VR transformational game that elicits compassion for visually impaired individuals.

The game is about a person who wakes up in a
dark tunnel and has to find their way out into
daylight, with the aid of eco-location and very
limited light source.

They have to find some game objects
while wandering around in the dark tunnel, that
will help them along their journey.

With this in mind, it
is our goal to help the players utilize their auditory
sensory organ and enlighten their perception of
visually impaired individuals; who have to live
their lives in this state, continually.
